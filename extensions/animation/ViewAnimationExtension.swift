     Adding image-title padding is possible, but takes some trickiness with contentEdgeInsets, titleEdgeInsets, and imageEdgeInsets.
     
     contentEdgeInsets
     contentEdgeInsets is probably the easiest insets property to reason about. The insets apply padding to the content of the button, and they're taken into account in the button's instrinsicContentSize (which was what I expected).
     Positive values expand the button away from its content
     Negative values contract the button towards its content
     With negative contentEdgeInsets, it's possible to get the image and text to draw outside of the button's bounds.
     
     imageEdgeInsets
     imageEdgeInsets affects the drawing rect of the button's image, and does not figure into the button's intrinsicContentSize (this is different than contentEdgeInsets, which contributes to the intrinsicContentSize).
     Positive values contract the drawing rect towards the image's center
     Negative values expand the drawing rect away from the image's center
     Because imageEdgeInsets modifies the drawing rect, setting positive values can result in a squished image - with correct insets, you can actually flip the image! Negative values have the effect of translating the image, they expand the drawing rect back instead of contracting it.
     
     titleEdgeInsets
     titleEdgeInsets affects the drawing rect of the button's title, and like imageEdgeInsets does not contribute to the button's intrinsicContentSize.
     Positive values contract the drawing rect towards the center of the title
     Negative values expand the drawing rect away from the center of the title
     As the title's drawing rect compresses (i.e., as positive insets are added), letters get cut off with ellipses. As with imageEdgeInsets, negative values translate the text without otherwise affecting the button's layout.

     redBox.layer.maskedCorners = [.layerMinXMinYCorner, .layerMaxXMaxYCorner]
